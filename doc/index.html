<h0 id="user">User guide</h0>
<p>
The Spirit interface is divided into five tabs. Each tab gives a different view of the same data, but with a different presentation.
</p>

<h1 id="home">Home</h1>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="home.png"><img src="home.png" title="Home Page"/></a>
	The <b>Home</b> tab is the first thing you see when starting Spirit. It shows the latest changes and allows the user to have a quick overview of the studies being worked on. For each study, it shows the data, that was generated and who did the latest modifications and when.  
	<ul>
		<li>Clicking on a study will redirect the user to the study visualization tab and open the clicked study.</li>
		<li>Clicking on a biotype will redirect the user to the biosample tab and display those biosamples</li>
		<li>Clicking on a test will redirect the user to the test tab and display the results of this test. The user can also click on "Analyze" to have a quick analysis of the results.</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="alert alert-info">
		Note: You can press F1 at any time in the application, to be redirected to the appropriate section of the help
	</div>
</p>

<h1 id="study">Study</h1>
<p>
    The study tab shows the study centric view of Spirit. This is where the user can query studies and work on the design.
</p>

<h2 id="study_visualization">Visualization</h2>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study1.png"><img src="sc_study1.png" title="Study Page"/></a>
    On the study tab, you can query all the studies of the system, provided you have read access on the studies. By default and before making any search, Spirit will show you all the studies where your name is explicitely written in the list of users.
</p>
<p>
    To query for a study, you can either:
    <ul>
    <li>browse through the list of studies by clicking on the studyIds popup: several studies can be selected by keeping the button "Ctrl" pressed.
    <li>type some keywords in the "Study Search" field: Spirit will search all studies for the matching keywords in the title or in any of the other metadata. Complex queries such as "Example and (stratification or splitting)" are possible.
    </ul>
</p>

<h3 id="study_vis_design">Design</h3>
<p>
    The bottom left part shows the visual design of the study. The visualization may change a lot depending of the type of study. The following studies are given as examples in the system:
	
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xs-4">
			<b>Basic study:</b><br>
			<a class="fancybox" href="sc_study2.png"><img src="sc_study2.png"/></a>This is a basic study with 3 groups, lasting 7 phases. At day0, 5 animals are assigned to each group, and the treatment is given. From day1 to day6, a blood sampling is performed and at day 7, the animals are necropsied. The "w" signs shows that the animals have to be weighted every day.
		</div>
		<div class="col-xs-4">
			<b>Study wih subgroups:</b><br>
			<a class="fancybox" href="sc_study3.png"><img src="sc_study3.png"/></a>At day0, the animals are split into 2 groups (healthy, sick), but it is only at day2 that the animals are split again (Treated, NonTreated), based on some criteria like the weight.
		</div>
		<div class="col-xs-4">
			<b>Study wih subgroups</b><br>
			<a class="fancybox" href="sc_study4.png"><img src="sc_study4.png"/></a>When a lot of work has to be done, subgroups or stratification helps to split the work on several phases. Here, each group of 9 animals is split into 3 subgroups.  
		</div>
	</div>
		
</p>

<h3 id="study_vis_infos">Infos</h3>
<p>
    The bottom-right of the study tab shows the other infos of the study. There are 3 tabs there:
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xs-4">
			<b>Samples:</b><br>
			<a class="fancybox" href="sc_study5.png"><img src="sc_study5.png" title="Study Samples"/></a>This tab shows the list of biosamples attached to the study. The <strong>attached samples</strong> are the samples, that are follow the actions from the study design. If those samples have some children, it is possible to double-click to view all the samples, that have been collected.
		</div>
		<div class="col-xs-4">
			<b>Samplings:</b><br>
			<a class="fancybox" href="sc_study6.png"><img src="sc_study6.png" title="Study Samplings"/></a>This tab shows the <strong>sampling templates</strong> associated to the study. The sampling templates describes the samples the samples, that should be taken and how they should be taken. This example shows that the "blood sampling" consists of 2 aliquots of 5ml stored in Micronics, and that the "Necropsy" consists of the heart, the lung (left and right stored in one bottle), all of which have to be weighted ("w").
		</div>
		<div class="col-xs-4">
			<b>Infos</b><br>
			<a class="fancybox" href="sc_study7.png"><img src="sc_study7.png" title="Study Infos"/></a>This is the default tab, which shows the title, the infos, the workflow state, the user rights and all the data coming from this study. You can click on the "biosamples" link to be redirected to the biosample tab, or on the "results" link to be redirected to the result tab.
		</div>
    </div>
</p>
<h2 id="study_edit">Editing</h2>

<h3 id="study_infos">Infos</h3>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study8.png"><img src="sc_study8.png" title="Study Popup"/></a>
    To create/edit a new study, you can either go the menu or <strong>right-click on a study to open the contextual menu</strong>. Right-click works on almost everything in Spirit, and will make the appropriate popup menu open. If some options are grayed out, it means you don't have sufficient right, and you should contact one of the responsible person to add you on the list.
</p>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study9.png"><img src="sc_study9.png" title="Study Infos"/></a>
    On the study info dialog, it is possible to enter the fundamental information about the study:
    <dl>
    <dt>Parameters
    <dd>
        <ul>
            <li><b>StudyId: </b>is the unique Id, which is automatically generated by the system. Its format is: S-{00001}
            <li><b>InternalId: </b>is the non unique id, used in the organisation, such as an invivo, toxicology number, or the id from an external organisation
            <li><b>Title: </b>is the description of the study
            <li><b>Generate Samples automatically.: </b>this option is selected by default, it means that the samples are going to automatically generated as described in the study design.<br>
            There are however cases, where the automatic generation and deletion of samples will lead to unwanted effects (studies entered a posteriori, or studies where each patient will get completely different samples). In those cases, it is better to uncheck it, and let the user create the samples manually.
        </ul>
    <dt>Metadata
    <dd><strong>Study metadata</strong> are configurable, so the list of metadata may depends of the Spirit configuration you have. All those fields are searchable and displayed in the study table.
    <dt>State
    <dd>The <strong>worklow states</strong> are also configurable by a system administrator. The attached table shows the configured states and the configured rights for each of those states: "ALL" means everybody has the rights, otherwise the rights are restricted to the given role and users.
    <dt>User Rights
    <dd>The <strong>user rights</strong> are shown only if a user database is configured (when Spirit is run in a server mode). There you can enter the usernames of the user who have: 
        <ul>
            <li><b>Admin rights: </b> can change the infos/the design of the study and attach samples.
            <li><b>Experimenter rights: </b> can add samples or results to the study.
            <li><b>Blind-Details: </b> limited rights on the study, but enough to view the design. The groups are shown, but without the groupNames (only the short abbrevation is shown) and without the compound (only the treatment's abbreviation is shown). This is the recommended role for technicians, who have to apply treatments.
            <li><b>Blind-All: </b> limited rights on the study. All informations about the groups and the treatments are hidden, including the colors and the abbreviation. It is not even possible to see if two samples come from the same group. This is the recommended roles for technicians, who have to make the observations or other measurements.
        </ul>
    <dt>Notes: 
    <dd>Anything goes here.
    </dl>
</p>

<h3 id="study_design">Design</h3>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study10.png"><img src="sc_study10.png" title="Study Design"/></a>
    Go to the study design by right-clicking on the study and selecting "Edit->Study Design".
</p>

<h4>1. Infos</h4>
<p>
Please look at the section <a href="#study_infos">above</a> to have an explanation of this
</p>

<h4>2. Documents</h4>
<p>
    You can attach as many documents as you want in the study. Documents are categorized in "Consent Form", "Design", "Presentation", "Other" and are for documentation purpose.
    The <strong>consent form</strong> is a special type of document. By adding a document, all samples from the study are highlighted in red, with a link to the consent form.
</p>

<h4 id="study_phase">3. Phases</h3>
<p>
    The phases define the timeline of the study. Phases can be formatted as: 
    <dl>
    <dt>d0, d1, d3:
    <dd><p>Use the "day, hour, second" format if the event happen at a precise time. Negative days (d-1) are used for the pre-study observation. d0 is normally used for the group assignment or first treatment.</p>
    <p>It is possible to enter hours, minutes and a label by using this format: "d0_6h30 instillation"</p>  
    <p>It is possible to enter a starting date to have absolute dates for the phases. By using absolute dates, Spirit can indicate when each action should take place (treatments, samplings, measurements).</p>
    <dt>1. Baseline, 2., 3. EOT: 
    <dd>Use this format when actions don't take place at exact dates, but at some point of time. The phases become markers for the baseline, end of treatment, first visit, ... 
    </dl>
</p>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study11.png"><img src="sc_study11.png" title="Study Design - Phases"/></a>
	To add phases, right click on the table and select "add rows". You can also use the up/down keyboard to add phases at the bottom/top of the table.<br>
	To remove phases, right click on the table and select "delete rows". You can also click delete on the keyboard to remove the selected phase. Make sure you have no samples or results attached to that phase.<br>
	To rename, simply select the phase and type the new name.<br>
	

</p>

<h4 id="study_group">4. Groups</h4>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study12.png"><img src="sc_study12.png" title="Study Design - Groups"/></a>
    When similar actions (same treatment, same sampling, same measurements) take place on several biosamples, those biosampes should be put together in a group. 
</p>
<p>
    Each group needs to be defined with the following attributes:
    <dl>
    <dt>Group Definition
    <dd>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Abbreviation: </b> a short and unique id such as  1, 2, 3 or 1A, 1B. This is the identifier shown to the blind experimenter or displayed next to the sampleId throughout the application.
        <li><b>Name: </b> is the description of the group such as: Control, Sham, ...
        <li><b>Color: </b> is the background color used for the group and for the cage labels
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>Group Assignment
    <dd>When and how the specimen are assigned to this group? This feature is only useful if the experimenter wants to use the automatic group assignment, or for visualization purpose.
        <ul>
        <li><b>Normal group assignment:</b> the phase indicates when samples are attached to this group; the phase is optional if it is undefined. For studies where a group of animals (ex: sick) is splitted into 2 new groups (ex: treated and non-treated), you can indicate from which group this group originates.  
        <li><b>The initial samples are divided into subsamples:</b> this is a special scenario to indicate that the attached samples will be divided into other samples, that will be treated/analyzed over time. Example: a study of animals, where patches of skin are treated with different treatments.
        </ul>
    <dt>Group Size:
    <dd>This indicate the number of subgroups and the number of samples expected to be attached to each of them. The subgroups are used for samples, that should be compared together, but where each subgroup show some changes in the actions. Example: stratification.
    </dl>
</p>
<h4 id="study_treatment">5. Treatments</h4>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study13.png"><img src="sc_study13.png" title="Study Design - Treatments"/></a>
    Treatment are identified by:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Name: </b> short and selft explanatory name to describe the treatment. 
    <li><b>Color: </b> this is how the treatment will be shown in the design and to the experimenter. 
    <li><b>Compound 1, Conpound 2: </b>are the reference identifiers of the compounds. This info is hidden from users with blind-details rights.
    <li><b>Amount / Unit / Administration: </b> If an amount and a unit, Spirit calculates the amount to be given based on the weight.
    </ul>
</p>

<h4 id="study_sampling">6. Sampling Templates</h4>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study14.png"><img src="sc_study14.png" title="Study Design - Sampling Template"/></a>
    The sampling templates describes the samples to be taken. When you click the button "Add Sampling", you can either decide to start from an empty template or to import a template from a previous study and modify it.
</p>
<p>
    You should name the template with a self-explanatory name, and specify if it is a necropsy sampling. After a necropsy, the animal's status becomes unavailable.
</p>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study15.png"><img src="sc_study15.png" title="Study Design - Sampling"/></a>In each template, you may define any number of samples. To add a new sample, you can either click on "Add Sample" or click on the button next to each sample, and select "duplicate". For each sample, you must specify:
    <ul>
    <li>the <b>biotype</b>
    <li>the <b>metadata, amount, comments </b> The metadata depends of the selected biotype.
    <li><b>Container: </b> If the sample to be generated has to be kept, you must specify the type of container (matrix, fluidx, eppendorf, ...). If the container can contain several samples (bottle, bags, cassette, slides), you must specify the container's number. For example, the lung and the heart can be stored in the same bottle (#1) or in 2 separate bottles (#1 and #2).
    <li><b>Measurements: </b> When the sample is collected, it is possible to perform some measurements, such as measuring the weight, the length, some observations, or any other other measurement on one of the defined test. This list of measurements is used in the "sample measurement" dialog.
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>7. Actions</h4>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study16.png"><img src="sc_study16.png" title="Study Design - Actions"/></a>
    Once the treatments, sampling templates are defined, the user can specify on which groups and when those actions have to be performed.
</p>
<p>
    To add an action, select one of the option at the top, and then click on the study design at the intersection of a group and a phase to indicate the action to be taken.
    <ul>
    <li><b>Add measurement:</b> Weighing, Food, Water or on any other predefined test. Those measurements are done on the attached samples during the "live monitoring" and results are retrievable for analysis.
    <li><b>Add treatment: </b>select one of the treatments defined before and the group/phase to perform it. The treatment is displayed above the timeline.
    <li><b>Add sampling: </b>select one of the sampling's template defined before and the group/phase where the sampling has to be done. The sampling's template is displayed below the timeline in red. If the template is marked as "Necropsy", a cross shows the end of the timeline.
    <li><b>Add label:</b>you can type some text and have it displayed on the study. Labels are purely informative.
    </ul>
    You can also drag the mouse to add several actions at once.
</p>

<h3>Group Assignment</h3>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study17.png"><img src="sc_study17.png" title="Study Design - Actions"/></a>
    To attach biosamples to the study, right-click on the study, and select "Edit->Automatic Assignment" or "Edit->Manual Assignment".
    <ul>
    <li><b>Automatic Assignment: </b> The automatic assignment guides the user through a wizard to randomize the assignment based on some criteria like the weight or on some other data. This option is only valid on the phases, where groups are set to be assigned as defined in the <a href="#editGroups">group</a> section. 
    <li><b>Manual Assigment: </b>This option can be used anytime.
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Samples can only be attached to one study and to one group. To reuse the same sample across 2 studies or groups, the trick is to clone the samples. Example: to use ANL0001 in 2 studies, it is cloned to ANL0001A and ANL0001B (both inheriting from ANL00001). This process is automatically performed by Spirit.
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="cloning.png"><img src="cloning.png" title="Cloning"/></a>
</p>

<h4 id="study_auto">Automatic Assignment</h4>
<p>
    The <strong>automatic assigment wizard</strong> guide you through the steps of attaching the samples to the groups.<br>
</p>

<h5>1. Parameters</h5>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study18.png"><img src="sc_study18.png" title="Automatic Assignment - Parameters"/></a>
    The first part of the wizard gives overview of the groups to be assigned. You can enter the biotype of the samples to be randomized.
</p>

<h5>2. Randomization Data</h5>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study19.png"><img src="sc_study19.png" title="Automatic Assignment - Randomization data"/></a>
    The second part of the wizard is where you enter the randomization data.
    <ul>
    <li><b>Number of attached samples: </b>By default, this number shows the number of samples to be randomized. You can increase this number to start with more samples. Extra samples will not be assigned to a group (reserve).
    <li><b>Number of other data: </b>By default, the randomization is done on the weight only, but you can randomize over other criteria (blood pressure, ...).
    <li><b>Synchronize from current situation: </b>Expert feature. This tab shows the historic data, which was saved the last time you came to this dialog. If the samples were later modified, you may want to synchronize the historic data with the data currently in the database. This button is only enabled if there are samples already attached to the study.
    <li><b>Use Balance:</b> You can configure a Mettler-Toledo to weight the samples on the fly. See Annex / Balance Configuration to see how to configure an external balance. The balance configured, this option is enabled by default, and the weight is entered automatically.
    </ul>
</p>
<h5>3. Group Assignment</h5>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study20.png"><img src="sc_study20.png" title="Automatic Assignment - Group Assignment"/></a>
    The third part of the wizard is where the user makes the group assignment. 
    <ul>
    <li><b>Put Lightest / Heaviest to Reserve: </b> If you have more samples than needed, checking those boxes will put the extrema (compared to the average) in the reserve. Uncheck them if you want to consider all specimen in the randomization
    <li><b>Automatic Randomization:</b> Click to let Spirit do the randomization. It is possible to have a different result everytime this button is clicked due to the random permutations used in the algorithm.
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Spirit uses a simulated annealing algorithm to tests thousands of permutations until each group share similar characteristics (mean, standard deviation). The optimal randomization is the randomization, minimizing the following formula:
    <br>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="formula.png"><img src="formula.png" title="Automatic Assignment - Group Assignment formula"/></a>
</p>
<p>
    The group assignment can be done manually partly of fully, by dragging the sample from group to groups. You can also right-click on the sample and select <strong>"Fix group"</strong>, so that the randomization keeps those samples untouched.
</p>

<h5>4. Cage Assignment</h5>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study21.png"><img src="sc_study21.png" title="Automatic Assignment - Cage Assignment"/></a>
    To set cages automatically, click on the maximum number of samples per cages. Spirit will still try to average the number of animals per cages. If you have 12 animals and select a max of 5, Spirit will assign 4 animals in each cage instead of 5,5 and 2.
</p>
<p>
    The checkbox "Reuse previous CageId" is enabled if you have group splitting. In that case, you can decide if you want to reuse the same cages, or reuse new ones.
</p>

<h5>5. Saving</h5>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study22.png"><img src="sc_study22.png" title="Automatic Assignment - Saving"/></a>
    The last step of the wizard is where you review the group assignment, update the subgroups, renumber, enter the metadata, comments. If everything is fine, click the "Make the assignments" button to update the database to match this randomization. The "automatic renumbering" button is used to renumber the samples sequentially as displayed in this table.
</p>

<h4 id="study_manual">Manual Assigment</h4>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study23.png"><img src="sc_study23.png" title="Manual Assigment"/></a>
    In this dialog, you can directly type or copy/paste the samples with their group assignment. At any time, you can open the dialog to change the groups/subgroups, attach a new sample, or detach a sample from the study. 
</p>

<h2>Monitoring</h2>
<h3>Live Monitoring</h3>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study24.png"><img src="sc_study24.png" title="Live Monitoring popup"/></a>
    Right-click on a study and select "Live Monitoring", to monitor the actions to be done on each attached sample of the study.
</p>

<h4 id="study_overview">Overview</h4>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study25.png"><img src="sc_study25.png" title="Live Monitoring overview"/></a>
    The left pane of the overview dialog shows all the actions to be performed on the attached samples: group assignment, weighing, treatments as defined in the <a href="#studydesign">study design</a>.
</p> 
<p>
    For each phase, there is a summary of what has been done and what needs to be done. A green flag means all the actions have been done. Click on the "group assignment" to go to the <a href="#automaticassignment">"automatic assignment"</a> dialog, click on the phase button to go to the "Live Monitoring" dialog. Even if there are no programmed action for the measured day, you can click on the phase button and enter some measurements.
</p>
<p>
    If a starting date has been entered for the study, the date is shown and the current day is highlighted.
</p>
<p>
    On the right side of the dialog, the tables show the historic results:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Results: Weighings: </b>shows the weighing results with the percentage increase since d0 (or the closest of d0 if there is no d0).
    <li><b>Results: Observations: </b>shows the observations.
    <li><b>Results: Food and Water: </b>shows the food and water intake with the percentage increase since d0. Since we cannot distinguish the food and water by animals but only per cage, the results are the same for all animal in the same cage.
    <li><b>Manip: Treatment: </b>To view all given treatments .
    </ul>
    It is also possible to configure the display and export the data to DataWarrior, Excel or as CSV, as explained in the "Working with Results" paragraph.
</p>
<h4 id="study_monitoring">Live Measurements</h4>

    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_study26.png"><img src="sc_study26.png" title="Live Monitoring measurement"/></a>
    After clicking a phase, the Live Monitoring dialogs shows up. Spirit shows the required measurements specified in the study design, by default.
</p>
<p>
    There are no "Save" button in this dialog because the data is saved just after being entered, with the exact time. By saving the data on the fly, Spirit avoids any possible errors due to network errors or human errors (such as closing the dialog without saving).
<p>
</p>
    All yellow fields are required and automatically get the focus of the user. After entering each value, a popup dialog will show up to inform the experimenter about the treatment to be given, together with the calculated dose. For documentation purpose, the experimenter can also enter the formulation.
    Next to each value, Spirit displays the last measured value, and the percentage increase.
<p>
<p>
    By hovering the mouse cursor over a field, it is possible to view when the experimenter entered the last value. To enter a new value, click on the field and confirm you want to enter a new value.
</p>
<p>    
    If the user is among the <b>blind-details</b> users, he will not be able to visualize the group description and the compounds, but only the group abbreviation and the treatment's name.<br>
    If the user is among the <b>blind-all</b> users, he will not be able to visualize anything related to the group or the treatment. The users that are fully blinded cannot see if the specimen belongs to a group or not, nor if the specimen have to be treated ot not.

<h3>Biosample Table</h3>
<p>
    <a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_bio3.png"><img src="sc_bio3.png" title="Biosamples Table"/></a>	
	The biosample table shows the list of biosamples matching your criteria. It is dynamically rendered according to your criteria, and the width of each column is resized to fit the data into the screen as much as possible. Smaller monitors may lead to data displayed on 2 rows or to truncated data.<br>
<p>
<p>
	The columns displayed are:
	<dl>
		<dt>Container
		<dd>The container information (containerType, containerId, Amount, Location) is shown either in 1 combined or in 4 separated columns. You can switch between the "1 column" and the "4 columns" views by either double clicking on the header, or by right-clicking the header and selecting "Container" under "Expanded Columns".
		<dt>Study
		<dd>The studyId, group and phase are displayed. The StudyId is only shown if biosamples come from different studies.
		<dt>TopId
		<dd>This column is shown only if the biosamples have a parent (not shown on the table). The topId shows the sampleId and sampleName of the top biosample in the hierarchy, together with the group's abbreviation. You can expand the column to view the related metadata by double-clicking on the headr.
		<dt>Parent
		<dd>This column is shown only if the biosamples have a parent, which is different from the topId. This column can also be expanded
		<dt>SampleId
		<dd><p>The Sample identifier (sampleId, SampleName) is shown either in 1 or 2 columns. You can switch between the "1 column" and the "2 columns" by double clicking on the header or by expanding the column on the header popup. The group of the sample and its phase is also shown for a quick overview</p>
		<p>If the sample has some children, a [+] sign is displayed next to the sampleId. You can double-click to show/hide the children. The same can be done from the header popup menu, by clicking the appropriate option under "Hierarchy"
		<dt>Metadata</dt>
		<dd>The metadata are shown either in one unstructed column (if the table contains biosamples from different biotypes) or in multiple columns, showing each metadata. By default, only the main metadata are displayed (as configured in the biotype administration), but it is possible to add other columns by opening the header popup menu. The columns to be added are the following:
			<ul>
			<li><b>Quality:</b>The quality is normally shown on the sampleId by setting a red (bad quality) to green (good quality) background on the id of this column (if any).<br>
			For exporting and sorting purpose it is possible to add the Quality column.
			<li><b>Status:</b>The quality is shown on the sampleId by setting a specific background on the icon of column.
			<li><b>Items/Children:</b>This option counts the number of children per biosample.<br>
			Those biosamples are then counted by biotype/location. This is useful to check the number of available blood/organs per animals.
			<li><b>Results:</b>This option counts or display the results linked to the biosamples.<br>
			If there is one result available, the value of this result is displayed. Otherwise, the table displays the number of tests and results per biosample.
			<li><b>Ownership Change:</b>This option shows if the biosample had a change of ownership, and to whom it was given.
			</ul>
		<dt>Owner:		
		<dd><p>This column shown the date of creation, the user who created the sample and the owned department (if any). The user who created the sample is defined as the owner.</p>
	</dl>

	<p>Sorting is possible by clicking on the table's header (depending of the selected column, you can select the type of sorting: position by row or by columns). The first sort is done in ascending order, and the second in descending order. If you need to sort on multiple columns (group, phase), you should first sort on the phase and then on the group.<br>
	The sort algorithm is case insensitive and numbers are compared as numbers when they are not mixed with the text. ie. "Box 2" comes before "Box 10", but "Box2Top" comes after "Box10Top"
</p>

<h3>Detail Panel</h3>
	<p>The detail panel shows the detailled information related to the selected biosample.
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xs-3">
			<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_bio4.png"><img src="sc_bio4.png" title="Biosample Detail 1"/></a>

<h3>Pivot Biosamples</h3>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_bio8.png"><img src="sc_bio8.png" title="Pivot Biosample"/></a>	
	An alternative visualization is to pivot the biosample table, to count the number of biosamples based on some criteria. The attached figure shows the number of samples, where the group is shown on the rows, and the phase, biotypes are shown on the columns.
</p>
<p>To open this view, click on "Pivot Data". Upon checking this box, Spirit displays the number of biosamples currently in your table and a new dialog opens to configure the information to be shown. In this dialog, you can then drag and drop those items at the rows/columns/cells level to start counting the biosamples based on those criteria.
</p>
<p>
Use this function to count the number of organs per animal, to count the types of plasma samples taken at different timepoint per group in a study, or to count the number of animals used per year from each provider.
<br>

<h3>Exporting Data</h3>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_bio9.png"><img src="sc_bio9.png" title="Exporting Data"/></a>	
	On the top-right of the biosample table, you can see the three exporting options:
	<dl>
		<dt>DataWarrior
		<dd><a href="http://www.openmolecules.org/datawarrior/index.html">DataWarrior</a> is an open source visualization and analysis program, developed at Actelion and integrated in Spirit.
		<dt>CSV
		<dd>
		This option will export your table to a Comma Separated Value file, and open it with the software linked to the csv extension. This option is the best if you don't want any formatting, or if you don't have a program like Excel or Open Office, which can open the xlsx files.
		<dt>Excel
		<dd>This option will export the same table as for the csv option, with some formatting. 
	</dl>
</p>

<h2 id="biosample_editing">Editing</h2>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_bio10.png"><img src="sc_bio10.png" title="Biosample popup menu"/></a>
	To edit, select the biosamples to be edited, right-click to open the <b>biosample popup menu</b> and select the Edit option.
</b>	
<p>
	Editing is only enabled if you have sufficient rights (the biosample's owner is shown in green in that case). To have sufficient rights, you must be either one of the study's admin or experimenters if the sample belongs to a study, be in the same department if the sample has no study or be the owner of the sample.
</p>	

<h3 id="biosample_batch">Batch Editing</h3>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_bio11.png"><img src="sc_bio11.png" title="Biosample Batch Mode Editing"/></a>
	In batch editing, editing works like any spreadsheet (Excel). You can copy/paste from the clipboard, undo/redo your last actions.	The columns to be edited are similar to the ones described in the <a href="#biosample_visualization">biosample visualization</a>, at the exception that all columns are expanded to be easily editable. <br>
	The "batch editing" is the default dialog for the edition of living/solid/liquid samples, but it is possible to switch to the <a href="biosample_form">"Form Editing"</a> if there is only one sample to edit.
</p>
<p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Container
		<dd>There are up to 4 columns to edit the container's information, depending of the biotype configuration. The containerId is only editable after entering a containerType. For the location, you can either enter the full path like "Lab2 / Tank A / Tower 2 / Box 1 : A/04", a partial path like "Tower 2 / Box 1 : A/04", or browse the location by clicking the "Set" button. The user needs to have write access on the location. The amount column is displayed only if the biotype is set to have an amount. Those columns can be condensed in one column by double clicking the header (as shown in the <a href="#biosample_visualization">biosample visualization</a>) 
		<dt>Study
		<dd>There are up to 3 columns to edit the study's information. Those columns are shown by default for the living/solid/liquid samples, but they can be added manually (right click on the header's table to hide/show those columns if needed). The studyId/group can only be edited for the samples, whose parents are not in a study. The phase can only be edited if the parent does not have a phase. The studyId/group/phase is always inherited from the parent, and therefore cannot be changed if breaking this rule.
		<dt>ParentId
		<dd>In this column you can enter the parent of the sampleId. You need to have read access on the parent sample.
		<dt>SampleId
		<dd>You can keep the sampleId empty as it will be automatically generated, if you don't enter it. 
		<dt>Metadata
		<dd>The metadata columns depends of the biotype. Each column may show a different editor (alphanumerical, numerical, autocompletion, list, multi-list, file, link to an other sample) based on the biotype's configuration. A yellow background shows the mandatory fields. If the biosamples in the table have more than one biotype, there will be just one editable column with all the metadata, but copy/paste won't work.
	</dl>
</p>	
<p>
	To add more rows, you can simply go down with the arrow key and new rows will automatically created.
	You can also right-click on the table, select "Insert Rows" and the number of rows you wamt to insert.<br>
	It is important to know, that deleting a row from the table will not delete the sample but actually remove this biosample from the editing. If you right-click on the column, you can also sort the columns and add extra columns: ELB, quality, last update.
</p>
<p>
	
	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_bio12.png"><img src="sc_bio12.png" width="250" title="Biosample Batch Mode Editing"/></a>
	Validation is done when you click the button "Save".<br>
	A red color shows erroneous fields (unknown value for a list metadata or text for a numerical value) and will give the "invalid choice" error upon saving. 
</p>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_bio14.png"><img src="sc_bio14.png" width="450" title="Metadata correction"/></a>
	An orange color shows a warning (new entered value for an autocompletion metadata) and will lead to the "typo correction" dialog upon saving. In this dialog, each new value is checked and compared to the existing ones to suggest a replacement. In the next example: "Lung / RIGHT" should be replaced by "Lung/Right" and "Brain" is a new value with no suggestion. Click "Replace All" to accept the suggestions and leave keep the new values.
	<br>
	
	
</p>
<p>	
	<a class="fancybox " href="sc_bio13.png"><img src="sc_bio13.png" title="Biosample Set Location"/></a>

<h3 id="biosample_form">Form Editing</h3>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_bio15.png"><img src="sc_bio15.png" title="Biosample Form Editing"/></a>
	The "Form Editing" shows an expanded view of the sample to edit. It is the default editing mode for components (bacteria, cell line, antibody), due to the higher number of metadata for these biotypes. To switch to the <a href="biosample_batch">"Batch Mode"</a>, click on the Switch button.
</p>
<p>
	The edition in this view is very similar to the <a href="biosample_batch">"Batch mode"</a> and the same type validation applies here.

		<li><b>Checkout</b> is removing the location
	</ul>
	To set the locations, write access rights are required, and the samples should not be abstract.
</p>

<h4 id="biosample_checkin">Checkin</h4>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox" href="sc_bio21.png"><img src="sc_bio21.png" title="Checkin / Relocate"/></a>
	The selected biosamples are shown on the left panel of the checkin/relocate dialog. The destination location is shown on the right side.
	To enter a location, you can either type it by clicking on the location field and entering "Tower 2 / Box 1" or browse to the desired location. 
</p>
<p>
	To set the samples to the desired location you can:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Drag them</b> and move them to the new location. It is possible to change the location of any biosample in the box (provided you have the rights). To move several samples, use ctrl-click or shift-click to select several biosamples before dragging them
		<li><b>Double-Click</b> on the new position. The first click gives a preview of the new location, while the second click moves the samples. The way that samples are moved depends of the "direction". You can decide to assign the positions from "left to right", from "top to bottom" or to keep the same order/pattern (default) if the samples already has a position..
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	A new location can also be created directly from this dialog.
</p>

<h4 id="biosample_checkout">Checkout</h4>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox" href="sc_bio22.png"><img src="sc_bio22.png" title="Checkout"/></a>
	To checkout biosamples, select them and click "checkout" from the popup menu. Click "Checkout" in the confirmation dialog to remove them from the location.
</p>

<h3>Advanced</h3>
<h4>Delete Batch</h4>
<p>
	Delete Batch is used when biosamples should be deleted from the database. Use this function to delete the physical sample as well as the virtual sample. After deletion, the only way to restore it is from the audit trail. Only the owner of the biosample or an admin can delete.<br>
</p>
<h4>Help Me Select Some Biosamples</h4>
<p>
	This is an advanced feature, to help you select biosamples based on some criteria. <br>
	<br>
	For example, let's say you want to make an experiment using several antibodies on different target, and you want to make sure that each antibody has a fluorophore working on a different wavelength. In this case, you should set the query criteria on the antibody's target and you should set the discriminator to the fluorophore's wavelength. Then after entering each antibody's target, Spirit will give you all the matching antibodies and let you select one antibody per target. After you select an antibody, Spirit will gray out the antibody with the same fluorophore's type (as set in the discriminating criteria).
</p>

<h4>Change Ownership</h4>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_bio31.png"><img src="sc_bio31.png" title="Biosample history"/></a>
	It is possible to change the owner/department of a biosample through this function.
</p>
<h4>Change History</h4>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox" href="sc_bio30.png"><img src="sc_bio30.png" title="Biosample history"/></a>

	The edition of locations is done through this table:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Parent: </b> The parent container, which is optional.
	<li><b>Type: </b> the type of the location:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Building</b>, <b>Lab</b>: are admin locations, that only administrators can create.
			<li><b>Freezer</b>, <b>Shelf</b>, <b>Drawer</b>, <b>Tank</b>, <b>Tower</b>: are locations that any user can create to organize its lab. They can contain children location.
			<li><b>Box</b>, <b>Rack</b>, <b>SlideBox</b>, <b>Bag</b>: are location container, which contains biosamples and have a configurable size.
		</ul>
	<li><b>Name: </b> identifier of the location. The parent/name combination must be unique.
	<li><b>Labelling: </b> If the location has a configurable size, you can configure the display of the positions: None, A1,A2,...; 1,2 (horizontal); 1,2 (vertical) 
	<li><b>Rows / Cols: </b> If the location has a configurable size, you can also specify the dimensions. Those values are optional, if the labeling is "None"
	<li><b>Privacy / Department: </b> If you run Spirit in a user-manager environment, you can setup specific rights to each location. Doing so, you can restrict the organisation of a lab to a specific department.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Inherited:</b> the default, same privacy as the parent location
			<li><b>Public:</b> the biosample's location is readable by everybody, provided you have read access on the sample.
			<li><b>Protected:</b> the biosample's location is shown as hidden to users who are not member of the specified department. This is recommended visibility for the organization of the labs.
			<li><b>Private:</b> the content of the location is completely restricted to the specified department. Biosamples inside this location are not visible/searchable to those outside the department, even if they should have access to the study/biosamples. This is the recommended visibility for backups storages.
		</ul>
	<li><b>Description: </b> The description is shown next to the name, and printed on the location's label
	</ul>
	To add new locations, you can add rows by moving down with your mouse.

<h1 id="result">Results</h1>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox" href="sc_res1.png"><img src="sc_res1.png" title="Results"/></a>	
	On the result's tab of Spirit, the results become the main focus of your work. There you can query, manipulate and export your data how you like. The left side of the screen is used to enter the query, and the right side is used to display and manipulate the results.<br>
</p>

<h2 id="result_visualization">Visualization</h2>
<h3 id="result_search">Search Pane</h3>
<p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xs-6">
			<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_res2.png"><img src="sc_res2.png" style="width:170px" title="Results"/></a>	
			The <b>result search pane</b> allows you to query by studyId, topId, keywords and tests.
			Before entering any study, Spirit shows an overview of the results already entered in Spirit. Next to each test, the number of entered results is shown in braces.
		</div>
		<div class="col-xs-6">
			<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_res3.png"><img src="sc_res3.png" style="width:170px" title="Results"/></a>	
			After entering one or several studyIds, Spirit shows the list of results in those studies. New filters for the biotype and the analytes become available once you select a test. 
		</div>
	</div>
</p>
<p>
	Complex queries are possible through the <b>keywords</b> search. The following operators are possible AND, OR, (, ), * and ".<br>
	Examples:
	<ul>
		<li><i>Healthy</i>: to query results on biosamples on groups containing Healthy
		<li><i>Lung</i>: to query results on biosamples on lung, lungs/left, lung/right
		<li><i>Mesoscale Fluid IL-15</i>: to query Mesoscale results on Fluid with the IL-15 analyte. <b>AND is used as the default operator</b>
		<li><i>Plasma France</i>: to query results linked to plasma from patients in France.
		<li><i>Mesoscale (Organ or Fluid)</i>: to query Mesoscale results done on organs or fluid.. <b>You can combine () and OR operators</b>
		<li><i>"Lung"</i>: to query results on biosamples on lung. <b>Quotes are used for exact matches</b>.
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The keywords searches all the related fields of the result: study, group, phase, topId, topName, topMetadata, parentId, parentName, parentMetadata, sampleId, sampleName, sampleMetadata, sampleBiotype, test, testInput, comments, user, electronic lab notebook, ...<br>
	The search is case-incensitive and ignore the special characters (.;/_-,#), so that searches on "IL15" will find all result on "IL 15", "IL-15", ...
</p>

<h3 id="result_table">Result Table</h3>
<p>
	After clicking search, the retrieved results are displayed on the <b>result table</b>. There are many ways to present the results and the biosample information linked to those results. Select a predefined <b>template</b> on top to choose between these views:
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xs-6">
			<a class="fancybox" href="sc_res4.png"><img src="sc_res4.png" title="Results Compact"/></a>	
			The <b>Compact</b> template shows all the result in a compacted form, to have a quick visualization of the type of results.<br>
			If the results are heterogeneous (several tests, done on different biotypes and different analytes), this template displays the different conditions of the test in each cell. In that case, exporting to Excel is troublesome<br>
			If the results are homogeneous (one test on different analytes), this template is similar to the <b>Column</b> template and the analytes are displayed at the columns level.
		</div>
		<div class="col-xs-6">
			<a class="fancybox" href="sc_res5.png"><img src="sc_res5.png" title="Results Column"/></a>	
			The <b>Column</b> template is the preferred template for exporting to third party analysis tools. Each column displays a different test condition.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xs-6">
			<a class="fancybox" href="sc_res6.png"><img src="sc_res6.png" title="Results Flat"/></a>

<p>
	In this dialog, you can see all available items. Each is a (non-empty) piece of information linked to the result. Items like the "Location", "Animal Sex", "Plasma State" can be added to the display by dragging them with the mouse to the "Rows", "Columns" or "Cells" level. Changes to the template are shown in real time.
</p>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox" href="sc_res8.png"><img src="sc_res8.png" title="Results Customize Template"/></a>	
	In this example, we display for each Group ("GroupName", "Animal.Type", "Animal.Sex", "ELB" displayed as Row) and for each test's condition ("TestName", "Input" displayed as Columns), the average of the values, the coefficient of variation and the number of values, used for the calculation.<br>
</p>

<h4 id="result_detail">Result Detail</h4>

</p>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox" href="sc_res12.png"><img src="sc_res12.png" style="width:inherit" title="Analyze"/></a>	
	Each test condition (test, biotype and input) is analyzed. For each condition, Spirit calculates:
	<ul>
		<li><b>the number of groups</b>
		<li><b>the number of values</b>
		<li><b>the distribution</b>: from the distribution displayed in the histogram, Spirit assess the type of distribution: "Normal", "Log Normal" or "Uniform". A log-normal distribution will be displayed using a logarithmic scale.
		<li><b>the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) value</b>: The KW value shows how significant our test is. The lower this value is, the more significant the test is to differentiate two groups from our dataset.
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The different conditions are sorted by the KW value. A green background is shown when the groups are well differentiated (KW&lt;0.05) and a red background is used when groups cannot be differentiated (KW&gt;0.2)
</p>

<h4>Export to DataWarrior</h4>

<h2>Import/Export</h2>
<h2>Export</h2>
<p>
	It is possible to export Spirit data using the <b>Spirit File Format</b>. The Spirit File Format is a proprietary format which encapsulates the studies, biosamples, locations, results, biotypes and tests of the data you want to export. It is self-contained, meaning that the data exported contains everything to rebuild the exported data somewhere else (ie, if you export results, all the linked biosamples, biotypes and tests will also be exported). The file is a JSON text readable format (human readable), and it could actually by manipulated by the user or an other program.
</p>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_adv1.png"><img src="sc_adv1.png" title="Export dlg"/></a>		
	To Export data, go to the "Edit" menu of Spirit and select "Export Data". In this dialog, you must decide what you want to export:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Export data from the current view:</b> with this option, you can make a query in any of the Spirit perspective and Spirit will export only the data needed to reconstruct the result of your query.
		<li><b>Export data from the following studies:</b>You can type the studyIds to export the study design, as well as all the associated biosamples (and their types), location, results (and their tests)
		<li><b>Export all biotypes/tests:</b>This is to export the definition of your biotypes/tests
		<li><b>Export everything:</b>This option is only possible if you have less than 10 studies, as the file may be potentially too big to export more data.

	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_admin8.png"><img src="sc_admin8.png"  title="Recent Changes"/></a>
	In this dialog, you can configure how Spirit connects to the database. There are 3 available configurations:
	<dl>
		<dt>HSQL Local database for 1 user
		<dd>This is default configuration. With this configuration, Spirit can be tested without any other installation any other user settings. Spirit runs without any user management, and the logged in user is the administrator of the system. The HSQL database is file based, and you can specify or change the file to create/reuse an old database.
		<dt>HSQL Server database
		<dd>You can use this configuration to run Spirit in a multi-user environment. User accounts will need to be created.
			<ul>
				<li><b>Mode:</b>Server/Client. You need to setup one computer as server, and this server must always be running for the client to connect to it
				<li><b>Path (server only):</b> directory where the HSQL database should store the file (files are only stored on the server)
				<li><b>Server (client only): </b> IP address or computer name of the server to connect to
			</ul>
		<dt>Production database
		<dd>To work with productive data, you need to install a database server with proper administration and backup. Spirit works with MySQL and Oracle
			<ul>
				<li><b>Vendor: </b>MySQL / Oracle
				<li><b>Connection URL: </b>path to the database server, which is a URL like jdbc:mysql://server:3306/spirit or jdbc:oracle:thin:@server:1521:test
				<li><b>UserId: </b>the user to be used to connect to the database (spirit if you created the user through "create user spirit identified by 'PASSWORD')
				<li><b>Password: </b>You can type the Spirit encrypted password given by an administrator or you type the "..." to encrypt the connection password given to the UserId				
			</ul>
	</dl>	
</p>
<p>
	The 3 buttons below are used to initialize the database:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Test Connection:</b> to test if the user/password/dbUrl are correct. It is not possible to save if this not correct
		<li><b>Test Schema:</b> to test if the tables of the spirit schema are well created. If unsuccessfull, Spirit will propose you to update those tables to match the expected schema. The update has to be done with care, please ensure the DB is well backed up before.
		<li><b>Recreate Examples:</b> to delete the existing examples and recreate them, if the user modified them.		
	</ul>

<h2 id="admin_usersettings">User Settings</h2>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_admin9.png"><img src="sc_admin9.png"  title="Recent Changes"/></a>
	The user settings are stored on the database and are therefore shared by all users conencting to the system. Hover your mouse on the question mark to have an explanation of each configuration item.	
</p>
<p>
	The available settings are:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Last changes:</b> the <a href="#home">Home Tab</a> shows the changes from the last N days. Use this setting to change it
		<li><b>Roles:</b> Enter a list of possible roles, that the user may have. Ex: FacilityManager, QA.
		<li><b>Login with one specific role:</b> By default, each user is logged with all its role. if this box is checked, the user needs to select its role (it becomes impossible to be an admin and a normal user at the same time)
		<li><b>Are user-rights role based only:</b> By default, the rights depends of the department. If this box is checked, the department is ignored and only the roles are used.
		<li><b>Data separation: </b>by default, Spirit under an <b>"open"</b> environment where all study designs are "viewable" and where all samples outside studies is readable by everybody. It is however possible to restrict it per department by selecting <b>"restricted"</b>: ie. only the biosamples created by the department of the logged in user are readable
	</ul>
</p>
<h2 id="admin_studysettings">Study Settings</h2>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_admin10.png"><img src="sc_admin10.png"  title="Recent Changes"/></a>
	The study settings define the metadata of the study and the different workflow's state	
	<dl>
		<dt>Metadata
		<dd>Metadata are extra information displayed on the study's table, which can be edited in the <a href="#study_infos">Study Infos</a> dialog. Enter the list of metadata in this field. For each metadata, you can configure
		<ul>
			<li><b>Name:</b> the name shown to the end user
			<li><b>Datatype:</b> List, Alpha, Auto
			<li><b>Parameters:</b> if the datatype is list, please enter the list of possible choces
			<li><b>Roles:</b> if the edition of this field is restricted to specific roles, please enter these here. 
			<li><b>States:</b> if the edition of this field is restricted to specific workflow states, please enter these here. 
			<li><b>Required:</b> If this field is required and editable (appropriate state, user role), the user will be required to fill in this metadata
		</ul>
		<dt>States
		<dd>States are the list of possible states the study can have. It is possible to build a workflow, by restricting the promotion rights to some users and by restricing the promotion from some specific states.
		<ul>
			<li><b>From:</b> are the previous allowed states to promote. If empty, there will be no restriction
			<li><b>Promoters:</b> are the roles of the user allowed to promote. If empty, there will be no restriction
			<li><b>Read:</b> to indicate the roles of those with read access to the study in this state
			<li><b>Experimenter:</b> to indicate the roles of those with experimenter access (add biosamples, results) to the study in this state
			<li><b>Admin:</b> to indicate the roles of those with admin access (edit design, infos) to the study in this state
			<li><b>Sealed:</b> to indicate the study cannot be modified anymore in this state. All other rights are ignored
		</ul>
		It is important to not that the right's coming from the roles and those coming from the department are cumulative.

<h1 id="admin_user">Edit User/Groups</h1>
<p>
	The menu "Admin" > "Edit User/Groups" is only active if Spirit runs under a user managed configuration.
</p>
<h2>Edit User</h2>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_admin11.png"><img src="sc_admin11.png"  title="Edit Users"/></a>
	This dialog shows the list of user with their manager, their roles and their department. Use this interface to add a new user, delete one, edit or disactivate one.
</p>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_admin12.png"><img src="sc_admin12.png"  title="Edit User"/></a>
	
	When adding or editing a user, you have the following options:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Username: </b> unique
	<li><b>Password: </b> Click "Reset" to suggest a password, to be given to the user. The user is then responsible to change it.
	<li><b>Manager: </b> If a manager is given, this manager will get all the read / edit rights of this user.
	<li><b>Disabled: </b> If a user becomes inactive, check this box to prevents him from logging in into this system. The same could be achieved by deleting the user.
	<li><b>Group: </b> If a group is mentioned, the biosamples created by this user will also be assigned and shared to this group.
	<li><b>Roles: </b> You can specify if this user has "admin", "readall", or any other roles specified in the <a href="#admin_database">Database Settings</a> dialog
	</ul>
	When entering a new password (by clicking the button "Reset") to a user, the user should change his password through the menu "Database" -> "Change Password"
</p>
<h2>Edit Groups</h2>
<p>
	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_admin13.png"><img src="sc_admin13.png"  title="Edit User"/></a>	
	The second tab of the user administration tab is used for managing the groups.
</p>
<p>	
	It is possible to define groups in a hierarchical way: ie. Biology, Biology / Lab1, Biology / Lab2, ... This does not imply however that members of the Biology group have some access on data from Lab1 or that members of Lab1 have access on data from Biology. The hierarchy is only there for display, as each group is considered independant from the other.<br>

<p>
	<a class="fancybox pull-xs-right" href="sc_admin3.png"><img src="sc_admin3.png"  title="Biotype definition"/></a>
	Clicking "Edit" or "New Biotype" brings the "biotype edition dialog"
	<dl>
	<dt>Biotype</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Name:</strong> must be unique
	<li><strong>Category:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Living</strong>
		The "Human" and the "Animal" biotypes are the 2 strong representants of this category. They are essentially used to be attached to studies, and as parent of other samples
		<li><strong>Solid sample</strong>
		Non purified solid samples coming are in this category. They typically have a living sample as a parent and a weight. Examples: "Tumor", "Organ"
		<li><strong>Liquid sample</strong>
		Non purified solid samples coming are in this category. They typically have a living sample or an other non purified sample as parent and they have a volume. Examples: "Blood", "Plasma", "Serum", "Homogenate"
		<li><strong>Purified sample</strong>
		Purified samples, such as "Antibody", "Bacteria", "Primer", "Cell Definition". They don't necessarily come from a specific living sample or have a parent. They are usually not used in studies, but used to keep an inventory of available components.
		<li><strong>Library:</strong>
		Libraries consist of all abstract samples, which could be referenced by other samples. Example: "Fluorophore", referenced by "Antibody".
	</ul>
	<li><strong>Inherited from:</strong>
	Expert feature to force a given biotype to have a specific parent. Example: "Cells" inherit from "Cell Batch", which inherit themselves from "Cell Definition". It should only be used if you can say that the child biotype inherits all properties from his parent. Leave empty in all other cases.
	<li><strong>Prefix:</strong>
	The sampleId can be prefix by an prefix (letters or digits). It is optional, but recommended.<li><strong>The sampleId is editable by the user:</strong>
	Check this box if the sampleId should be editable, ie if it is meaningfull to the user. Example, the patientId or animalId should be editable by the user, whereas an organId has no meaning and should be generated
	<li><strong>Hidden</strong>
	Check this box, if you want the end-user to select this biotype. If checked, only an administrator would be able to create new samples of this type. However, existing samples are still searchable.
	</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>Container</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Abstract:</strong>Check this box to prevent biosamples to have a container or a location.
	<li><strong>No ContainerId:</strong>Check this box, if the biosample can have a container and a location, but to prevent the user from entering a containerId.
	<li><strong>ContainerType:</strong>Select a containerType if you want to force all biosamples from this biotype to have a specific type of container. Example: all animals in a cage.
	<li><strong>AmountUnit:</strong>Select a unit of volume or a unit of weight if the amount of the biosamples can be measured. It is not possible to mix the units within a biotype. 
	</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>Main Metadata:</dt>
	<dd>The main metadata is the metadata, that is always displayed. It is the field that identify the biosample the best in its context. For example, the animal No is sufficient to identify the animal in the context of a study. The organ type is sufficient to identify the organ in the context of the animal,... The main metadata is optional. Uncheck the box, if there is no field to clearly describe a biosample.
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Name:</strong> is the label used to describe this metadata
	<li><strong>Autocomplete:</strong>Check this box if you want the system to do a typo check and suggest similar entries. Check this box to avoid having an organ called "Left Lung" and an other called "Lung/Left".
	<li><strong>Required:</strong>If checked, the user will not be able to save the biosamples if the field is empty
	<li><strong>View Entered:</strong>Click there to view the options already entered by the user and to rename possible typos.
	<li><strong>Convert to Metadata:</strong>Click to convert the main metadata to a regular metadata. This change requires to update all related biosamples in the system, thus creating a new version.
	</ul>
	<dt>Other Metadata</dt>	
	<dd>Metadata are used to describe precisely each instance of the bioype. Each one is define by:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Name:</b> unique 
			<li><b>Datatype:</b> One of:
				<ul>
					<li>Numeric
					<li>Alphanumeric
					<li>Autocomplete: the system will check for typos by suggesting closely matching entries
					<li>Date / Time
					<li>File
					<li>Choice: One: the user can select one value from a predefined list, such as male / female
					<li>Choice: Multiple: the user can select several values from a predefined list. Other values from the list are also possible
					<li>Linked: Biosample: the user can select an other biosample from the specified biotype (ie: a fluorophore for an antibody)
				</ul>
			<li><b>Edit:</b> if the datatype is of type "Choice", you can edit the list of acceptable values. If the datatype is of type "Autocomplete", you can view the list of entered values and correct possible typos from the user. If the datatype is of type "Biosample", you can specify a biotype.
			<li><b>Req.:</b> check this box if the field should be required
			<li><b>Sec.:</b> check this box if the field is secundary. Secundary fields are not initially displayed on the main table but only the detail pane. It is advised to have a maximum of 6 primary metadata and to set all the long fields as secundary.
			<li><b>"+":</b>To insert/add a new metadata
			<li><b>"-":</b>To remove a metadata. This is only possible if the metadata is empty for all linked biosamples.
			<li><b>"Move..":</b>To Change the order of the metadata, or to move one as the main metadata.

</p>
<p>
	You can filter by userId, date and type of changes. Each revision shows the unique revision number, the user who did the change and when the change happened. Spirit shows the deleted entities in red, the created entities in green and the updates in orange
</p>
<p>
	There are 2 ways to restore entities from a previous revision:
	<ul>
		<li>Right-click on the revision number on the left pane and click <b>"Cancel this change"</b>: the modified entities will be reverted to the exact same state they were before this revision. ie. canceling a creation will actually delete those entities; canceling a deletion will actually recreate them.
		<li>Right-click on the entities on the center pane and click <b>"Restore this version"</b>: the entities you see will be restored to this state.
	</ul>
	To restore an entity, you will prompted for a reason, which will be stored in the comments of the restored entities, and new revision will be added.

<h2>Balance Configuration</h2>
To add a balance for the Live Study Monitoring and the Sample Weighing, go to the Spirit Menu and select Config->Config(Balance). It is expected that the balance writes a tab or comma separated text file with the measured weighings.
The link to this file has to be entered in the following dialog, together with the column number containing the Weighing. <br>
<br>
Spirit works well with the Mettler Toledo balances, and the columnNo should then be the second.<br>
<br>
<table><tr><td><img src="screenshot_config1.png"/><br><i>Screenshot of the Balance Configuration</i></td></tr></table>


<h2>Printer Configuration</h2>
Printing labels is done on a Brother PTouch printer. The advised format is 12mm but Spirit can handle any width above 9mm. 9mm is the minimum to have a 2D barcode visible.
To configure the printer, first add the Brother PTouch to the control panel of windows or your OS. To be automatically detected by Spirit, the printer must contain "Brother" or "-BR" in its name.<br>
<br>
The next step is to configure the printer. Open the properties panel of the printer, and make sure you have the proper paper size selected, and the options "Half Cut" and "Chain Printing" selected, the other properties don't matter.<br>
<br>
<table><tr><td><img src="screenshot_printer1.png"/><br><i>Screenshot of Brother PTouch Settings</i></td></tr></table>
<br>
Then you have the configure the medias (paper format) to be used for each type of container. To do this, go the Advanced->Label Format settings of the Brother Printer, and import the format for each container:<br>
<br>

The following table shows for each containerType, the names of the media that are looked upon by default. First Spirit checks for the name of the Container; if it is not found Spirit checks for the preferred dimension.
The dimensions shown here are the best suited, so that the label will overlap partly and stick well at -80C.<br>

<h1>Installation / Configuration</h1>
<h2>Installation</h2>

Spirit is based on a model-2 client-server architecture. The server is used to host the database and the application. The client is used to run the application and it communicates directly to the database, as shown in the next schema.
The 3 major components of this system are:
<ul>
<li><b>The Database: </b> which can be MySQL or Oracle. (or any other relational database with some adaptation)
<li><b>The Webserver: </b> which is used to host the applications (Spirit and DataWarrior), so that they can be retrieved from any client
<li><b>The Client:</b> with a Java Runtime Environment installed (1.6+). It can run on Windows, Linux, MacOS
</ul>
<br>
<table><tr><td><img src="install1.png"/><br><i>Architecture</i></td></tr></table>
<br>
<h4>DB installation</h4>
The database needs the following:
<ul>
<li>a user: "spirit"
<li>a schema "spirit", which contains all biological data
<li>a schema "osiris", which contains all chemical / employee data (if applicable)
<li>the database mode should allow optimistic locking. For MySQL, it means you must use the InnoDB engine (which is the the default for versions after 5.5)
</ul>
<br>
To initialize the schemas "spirit" and "osiris", use the SQL dump files "spirit.sql" and "osiris.sql" from the installation. <br>
<br>
The user spirit must have insert / select rights on all tables of the schema; update / delete rights must also be granted on all non-audit tables (ie all tables not suffixed by _aud)
<br>

<h4>WebApp installation</h4>
To install the Spirit webapp, you need to have a webserver like Tomcat install. For this, you must install the JDK (Java Development Kit) and start the Tomcat service.<br>
<br>
To install the Spirit webapp, copy spirit.war into the webapp directory of Tomcat. The application should deploy by itself under webapp / spirit.<br>
<br>
You should still configure the starter by editing the spirit.jnlp and dw.jnlp files to providing the good url to the server.

<h4>Client installation</h4>
On the client, you must install the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) and open a webbrowser at http://{server}:8080/spirit .
If everything is well setup, you should see a webpage, with a link to start Spirit.


<h2>Configuration of Spirit</h2>
Spirit is a Java application, run as a WebStart application. It is possible to change the default behaviour of Spirit, by changing the JNLP (Java Network Launching Protocol) file used to start Spirit. Those files can be edited in the spirit.war file provided with the installation.<br>
<br>

The default JNLP file is the following:
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;jnlp spec="1.6+" codebase="http://localhost:8080/spirit/spirit-bin"&gt;
	&lt;information&gt;

The important things in this file are:
<ul>
<li><b>codebase="http://localhost:8080/spirit/spirit-bin": </b> is the address of the webserver. <i>localhost:8080</i> should be replaced by the appropriate address
<li><b>java-vm-args="-Xmx1024M": </b> is the maximum amount of Memory Spirit can use. Here it means Spirit is allowed to use up to 1Go of RAM
<li><b>&lt;property name="jnlp.adapter" value="com.actelion.research.spirit.adapter.CustomAdapter"/&gt;</b> is the adapter to be used. By default, the CustomAdapter is used
</ul>

The Adapter is actually a Java class, which is injected into the program at startup. This class defines all the advanced aspect of Spirit: list of users, list of groups, user's authentification, user rights, connection to the database.

<h3>Starting Spirit with the Custom Adapter</h3>
The CustomAdapter is a simple Java class, which can be configured without writing specific code. To configure this adapter, you must edit the following lines of code:

<ul>
<li><b>&lt;property name="jnlp.adapter" value="com.actelion.research.spirit.adapter.CustomAdapter"/&gt;</b><br>
This line is mandatory to use the CustomAdapter
<li><b>&lt;property name="jnlp.custom.hdialect" value="org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect"/&gt;</b><br>
This line defines the hibernate dialect to be used. For MySQL, use "org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect". For Oracle 10, use "org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect"
<li><b>&lt;property name="jnlp.custom.driver" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/&gt;</b><br>
This line defines the JDBC driver to be used.  For MySQL, use "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver". For Oracle, use "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver"
<li><b>&lt;property name="jnlp.custom.dburl" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mysql"/&gt;</b><br>
This line defines the url (server:port) to access the database. It needs to be changed to the appropriate server in production
<li><b>&lt;property name="jnlp.custom.username" value="spirit"/&gt;</b><br>
This optional line defines the username used to access spirit (default is spirit)
<li><b>&lt;property name="jnlp.custom.password" value="653DBF45650D534F152281D5AE700BEC"/&gt;</b><br>
This line defines the password for the user spirit in an encrypted way. To avoid having the password here, you should read the section "How to write a proprietary adapter".
<li><b>&lt;property name="jnlp.custom.mode" value="RESTRICTED"/&gt;	</b><br>
This optional line defines the user right behaviour. If the value is "RESTRICTED" (default), users need to have specific READ rights, to read/view samples; in this mode, users from different labs cannot view what the other lab does. If the value is "OPEN", everybody (with login access) can view everything. See the Annex/User Rights for more infomration.
<li><b>&lt;property name="jnlp.custom.testquery" value="select 1"/&gt;	</b><br>
This optional line, defines a test query to check if the db is alive. For performance reasons, it is advised to leave this line empty to have no test query. If the connection to the db is lost, Spirit will then give an error message, but reinitialize the connection.
<li><b>&lt;property name="jnlp.custom.lastactivitydays" value="31"/&gt;	</b><br>
This optional line, defines how many days should be used for the last activity home page of Spirit (default to 31).


</ul>
<br>
The password can be changed by executing the program "java -jar updateDBpassword.jar". This program will encrypt the password to a hexadecimal encrypted string, which need to be copied to the value of jnlp.custom.password.<br>

<h3>How to start Spirit with your own SpiritAdapter</h3>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
Spirit comes already installed with some biotypes and tests, which could be used as examples. However there are some biotypes and tests, which should always be present as they are used in some part of the program:
<h3>Required Biotypes</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Animal: </b> should be registered as a "Living" biotype, and it must have a "DateOfDeath", so that it can automatically be populated when the user changes the living's status of the animal. The option to change the living status only works for the "Animal" biotype.
<li><b>Organ: </b> the SlideCare application enables the user to cut organs and to put them on slides
<li><b>Slice: </b> the cut organs are of type "Slice", and they can have a metadata "Staining", which is automatically populated by SlideCare
</ul>

<h3>Required Tests</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Weighing: </b> The weighing test contains no input attribute and just one output attribute containing the weight in g. It is used by the group assignment wizard and the monitoring tool to automatically register the used weight as a experiment result. The sampling weighing dialog also registers the organs's weight.
<li><b>FoodWater: </b> The FoodWater test contains no input attribute, the first output attribute with the Food (g) and the second output with the water (ml). It is used by the monitorign tool.
<li><b>FoodWater: </b> The FoodWater test contains no input attribute, the first output attribute with the Food (g) and the second output with the water (ml). It is used by the monitorign tool.
<li><b>Observation: </b> The Observation test contains one output attribute with the observation string. It is used by the monitoring tool, the sample weighing and the change living status.
<li><b>Length: </b> The length test contains one output attribute with the length in mm. It is used by the sample measurement dialog
</ul>
